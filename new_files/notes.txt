See if MAD is more stable for response times
Standard deviations are very responsive to the reponse times - which is why log is used
Without log, thresholds are easier to set

How are the response times shaped? 
Skewed normal distribution?
How about after log?


plot:
	x = ranges of durations (0-50, 50-100, 100-150, ...)
	y = number of counts/frequency of counts over window
	style: bar plot
