### Dotfiles ###
My dotfile configuration, including .vim and .bashrc

# Cloning
If the version of Git is low-ish, use
> git clone git@github.com:Dreaddune/dotfiles.git --recursive
to get submodules

# Installation

> ./setup

Recommended Tmux version is 2.6.
To get this as a local version, run

> ~/dotfiles/tmux/tmux2.6_local_install.sh

This installs libevent, ncurses and tmux2.6
